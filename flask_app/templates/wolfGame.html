            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p class="wolf-rules">The player who tees off first is the wolf, and each hole the order rotates (i.e. if
                the
                order
                on #1 is
                1,2,3,4 then the order on #2 is 4,1,2,3). The primary responsibility of the wolf is to select the teams
                for
                that hole.<br> Consequently, the first option the wolf has is to play alone. If made prior to hitting
                his
                tee
                shot, then that player is going Blind Lone Wolf, and if after, merely Lone Wolf (see scoring
                implications
                below).<br>

                If the wolf is not Lone, then he has the option of selecting a partner. The key aspect of Wolf is that
                you
                must select your partner after he or she hits his tee shot but before the next player shoots.<br> If the
                wolf
                has not selected a partner when the last player tees off, the last player is automatically on the wolf's
                team.

                After each hole, the players on the winning team earn a point. In the case that a player elected <br> to
                go
                Lone
                Wolf, he or she earns two points, and in the case a player goes Blind Lone Wolf, he or she earns three
                points. Points are paid to and from all players, so in a game of $1 Wolf with four players,<br> players
                win
                or
                lose $2 if there is no Lone Wolf. A Lone Wolf would win $2 from each of three players or lose a total of
                $3
                on a hole, and a Blind Lone Wolf would win $3 from each of three players or lose a total <br> of $3 per
                hole.</p>
